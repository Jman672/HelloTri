# HelloTri
Hello Triangle with Vulkan

//this entry is from July 12th 2025, I have just finished the physical devices portion of the tutorial and am finishing for the night with a working blank window
## Notes While Doing Vulkan Tutorial at https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html
- I am more following along and writing the code as needed rather than understanding and learning alongside the tutorial
    - Potentially beneficial to reread and try to fully annotate and understand everything though if I become proficient in use without understanding it is okay.
- I have not added the optional message callback system for manual control over debugging, but I may in the future just to see it 
- My understanding is certainly lacking since if I had to continue or recreate this tutorial without the guide, I would be cooked
- Should continue reading and following the code but maybe take more steps to fully understand everything before moving forward
    - Probably more important after at least finishing the hello triangle
- Eventually my lack of shader knowledge will catch up to me and be problematic, but that seems to be a much easier skill to learn as compared to trying to learn to use this low-level, complex, and difficult API
- Eventually this project should springboard my understanding into creating a full rendering engine with Robert that may eventually be included into a custom built game engine to drop the first void LLC. product
    - Definitely a long-term project/goal and will hopefully progress continually in the meantime
- Another cool note is that I am attempting to complete this tutorial project using only nvim to improve my typing skills and maybe attempt to master nvim at the same time
- I definitely need more knowledge in make and cmake to be useful moving forward as the projects get more intense and important
- This is definitely meant to be more of a learning experience and less of a true capital venture with an attempt to become successful
    - It will get the attention of a proper side project with some of my remaining free time after work, relationship, and friends

Overall, I am looking forward to learning more and more and will continue to add to this readme as a type of journal to catalog my experience
